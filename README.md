# DolphinNext 

DolphinNext allows users with little bioinformatics knowledge to analyze their own data on an HPC systems, Amazon Cloud or any workstation using a user-friendly drag and drop web interface. DolphinNext provides: 

1. A drag and drop user interface that abstracts NextFlow and allows users to create NextFlow pipelines without familiarity with NextFlow 
2. Reproducible pipelines by providing version tracking and by creating a stand-alone version of any pipeline instance that can be run independently. 
3. Seamless portability to distributed computational environments such as high performance clusters or cloud based solutions. 
4. A graphical user interface to monitor pipeline execution that allows restarting of intermediate processes even after parameter changes.
