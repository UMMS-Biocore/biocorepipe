Profile Page
============

Once you've accessed the profile page, you'll notice several tabs to explore.

The first tab is run environments. This is your main segment for creating connection profile. Second tab is groups where you can create group and add members to it. 
Next section is the SSH Keys, where you create new or enter existing SSH key pairs to establish connection to any kind of host. 
Fourth tab is called Amazon Keys where you enter your Amazon Web Services (AWS) security credentials to start/stop Amazon EC2 instances(https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

In order to submit a jobs to specified hosts, first create SSH Keys and then create connection profile in the run environments tab. 
If you want to create Amazon EC2 instances and submit your jobs to Amazon Cloud, then both SSH and Amazon Key are required before creating connection profile.
