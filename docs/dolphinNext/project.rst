Projects are platforms to categorize all of your runs and files. To run a pipeline, you need to first add selected pipelines into your project. There are two ways to create a new project and add pipelines to it:
    * 1. First click the Pipelines tab from the top left of the screen. Then select the pipeline you want run from left sidebar menu. At the right top of the page, you will notice "Run" button. This button opens new window where you can create new project by clicking "Create a Project" button. After entering and saving the name of the project, it will be added to your project list.
