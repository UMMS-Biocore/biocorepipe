Run Guide
*********

In the previous section (`project guide <project.html>`_), we saw the creation of project and adding pipelines to it. In this section, we will investigate the run settings to initiate our new run.

Basics
======
In the header of the run page, you will notice the rocket icon and the title of the run where you can also edit your run name. Tracking of your run is facilitated by project and pipeline links which are located just next to run name as shown at below:

.. image:: dolphinnext_images/run_header.png
	:align: center

Similar to `pipeline <pipeline.html>`_ section, **Save**, **Download Pipeline**, **Copy Run** and **Delete Run** icons are found in the header section to manage your run. Besides, optional **Run Description** section is exist just below the header section.

Run Status
==========
Run status is monitored at the right part of the header. Initially, orange ``Waiting`` button is shown. In order to initiate run, following data need to be entered:

    1. **Work Directory:**  Full path of the directory, where nextflow runs will be executed.
    2. **Run Environment:** Profile that is created in the `profile <profile.html>`_  page. If `Amazon profile <profile.html#b-defining-amazon-profile>`_  is selected, then status of the profile should to be at the stage of **running**.
    3. **Inputs:** Value and path of the files need to be entered.

.. warning:: If amazon s3 path is entered as a input or publish directory path, amazon keys (which will appear in the **Run Setting** section) need to be also selected.

All available status messages are listed at table below:

=========== =========================================================================================================================
Status      Meaning
=========== =========================================================================================================================
Waiting     Waiting for inputs, output directory and selection of active environment (\*amazon keys, if s3 path is used)
Ready       Ready to initiate run
Connecting  Sending SSH queries to selected host system
Waits       Job is submitted, waits for the execution
Running     Nextflow is executed and running the jobs.
Completed   Nextflow job is completed.
Run Error   Error occured before submiting the jobs or while executing the jobs.
Terminated  User terminated the run by using "terminate run" button.
=========== =========================================================================================================================

Run Settings
============

* **Work Directory:** Full path of the directory, where all nextflow runs will be executed. Example paths::

    ~/workdir
    /home/newuser/workdir

* **Run Environment:** Profile that is created in the `profile <profile.html>`_  page. If `Amazon profile <profile.html#b-defining-amazon-profile>`_  is selected, then status of the profile should to be at the stage of **running**.


* **Use Docker Image:** Nextflow supports the Docker containers which allows you to create fully reproducible pipelines. Docker image can contain any kind of software that you might need to execute your pipeline. It works transparently and output files are created in the host system without requiring any addition step. The only requirement is the `installation of the Docker <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`_ on the execution platform.  To activate this feature in DolphinNext just click the "Use Docker Image" checkbox and enter following information:

    1. **Image:** Docker image name. Example::

        nephantes/dolphinnext-docker

    2. **RunOptions (optional):** You can enter any command line options supported by the docker run command. Please click `this link <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/>`_ for details.

* **Use Singularity Image:** Alternative to Docker, you can activate singularity image by clicking "Use Singularity Image" checkbox and entering relevant fields. The only requirement is the `installation of the Singularity <http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-installation/>`_ on the execution platform.

    1. **Image:** Path to sigularity image. Example::

        project/umw_biocore/singularity/UMMS-Biocore-singularity-master.simg

    2. **RunOptions (optional):** You can enter any command line options supported by the ``singularity exec``. Please click `link for details <http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-usage/>`_. For instance, you can mount the directories by using ``--bind command``.  Example::

        --bind /project:/project --bind /nl:/nl --bind /share:/share

    .. tip:: Mounting directories in singularity requires you to create the directories in the image beforehand.


Advanced Options
================

* **Run Command (optional):** You may run the command or commands (by seperating each command with ``&&`` sign) before the nextflow job starts. eg::

    source /etc/bashrc && module load java/1.8.0_31 && module load bowtie2/2.3.2

* **Publish Directory:** Work directory is default publish directory for DolphinNext. If you want to enter new publish directory, just click this item and enter the full path of publish directory. Both local paths (eg. ``/home/user/test``) or amazon s3 paths (eg. ``s3://yourbucket/test``) are accepted.

* **Executor Settings for All Processes:** If any option other than local and ignite is selected as **nextflow executor** in the profile, it is allowed to override and adjust these settings by clicking this item. Following settings will be prompted: ``Queue``, ``Memory(GB)``, ``CPU`` and ``Time(min.)``.

* **Executor Settings for Each Process:** You may change executor settings for each process and override to **executor settings for all processes** by clicking this item and clicking the checkbox of process that you want to change. This will only affect the settings of clicked process and keep the original settings for the rest. Similarly, following settings will be prompted for checked process: ``Queue``, ``Memory(GB)``, ``CPU`` and ``Time(min.)``.

* **Delete intermadiate files after run:** This is default settings for DolphinNext to keep only selected output files in the work/publish directory and removing the rest of the files. Here the main goal is to minimize the required space for each project.

* **Permissions and Groups:** By default, all new runs are only seen by the owner. However, you can share your run with your group by changing permissions to "Only my groups" and choose the group you want to share from **group selection** dropdown.


Pipeline Files
==============
This section is separated into two groups: **inputs** and **outputs**.

* **Inputs:** The input file paths or values are entered by clicking **Select File** or **Enter Value** button. In order to select **multiple files**, wildcard characters ``*``, ``?``, ``[]`` and ``{}`` should be used. These arguments are interpreted as a `glob <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileOps.html#glob>`_ path matcher by Nextflow and returns a list of paths that are matching the specified pattern. Several examples to define inputs are listed below:

=========== ================================
Input Type  Example
=========== ================================
File/Set    /share/data/mm10.fa
File/Set    /share/validfastq/\*_{1,2}.fastq
Val         pair
Val         ~/scripts/filter.py
=========== ================================

* **Outputs:** When the run successfully completes, the path of the output files will be appeared in this region.

Workflow
========
To give you an overview, overall pipeline and its description are showed in this region. You may hide it by clicking minus/plus icon just next to **Workflow** title.

Run Logs
========
Log section will appear below of the **run description** as soon as you click the "Ready to Run" button. You can monitor each step of the run both before and after nextflow execution as shown at figure below.

If any error occured on any of these steps, detailed explanation about the error will be displayed in this section and run error sign will appear in the right side of the header as show in the example below:
